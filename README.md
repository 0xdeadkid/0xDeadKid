# hey, I’m 0xdeadkid 👾

15 y/o Linux goblin & C gremlin.  
I break stuff in the terminal until it magically works.

Sometimes I read man pages. Sometimes I cry.

## 🛠️ skills  
- **C**: write → compile → segfault → repeat  
- **Web**: HTML/CSS/JS (aka the front-end circus)  
- **Linux**: sudo sorcerer in training  
- **Git**: master of merge conflicts & last-minute commits  

---

## 🎯 goals  
- level up in **C** and webdev without rage-quitting  
- build stuff that *actually* runs (on purpose)  
- stop copy-pasting Stack Overflow answers (eventually)
